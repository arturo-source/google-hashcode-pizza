Solution for hashcode pizza problem 2017 and later

In this branch I try to solve the problem (still unsuccessful) by making a "slices logic", by iterating the slices stored in an array. This way I can safe memory, because without "slices logic" versi√≥n fill the RAM.

The main problem doing by this way is that `input/medium.in` and `input/big.in` files are too slow, even in the greedy method.
